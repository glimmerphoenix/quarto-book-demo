# Quarto book demo

This is a demo project that describes how to use Quarto to create reproducible books
in scientific programming, using Python and R.

- The first chapter illustrates how to combine Python code cells with formatted Markdown text.
- The second chapter presents and example of combining R code with Markdown content.
- The third chapter shows how to combine both Python and R cells *in the same file*. This is a distinctive
feature of this demo project.

## TODO list

- Improve step-by-step installation and configuration guides.
- Add many more example chapters, describing how to insert figures, tables, equations, callouts and many other elements.
- Explain in greater detail how to manage bibliographic references.
